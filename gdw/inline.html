<h1> Inline Elements </h1> 
<p> Inline elements make a block of text clear by bolding characters, italicizing, quotations and ect. For example to make a set of words stand out to the reader you would use the command <b> strong </b>. Bold and strong do almost the same thing. To put a set of words into qoutations you would use the <q> "q" </q> command </p> 
<p> In order for these commands to work, you have to open it and close it with the same command except, you have to add a <em>  slash </em>  before you type the frist word of the command.Inline elements are very helpful in making your text readable in a vareity of audiences.</p>
