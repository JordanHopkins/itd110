Properties — various attributes of an object, such as height, color, font size, sentence length and so forth.
Values — the specific qualities of properties. For instance, the statement color="red" assigns a value to a property.
Methods — the actions that an object can be made to perform, such as a calculation, an onscreen move or the writing of text into a window. Methods often describe the actions that an object performs with its properties.
