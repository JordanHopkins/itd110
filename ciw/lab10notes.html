Rendering	Client device does most of the work of optimizing the page for smaller devices, including adjusting for screen size and portrait-vs.-landscape orientation	A smaller, easier-to-navigate version of the full site
Server still does most of the work of optimizing the page for smaller devices
Coding	One set of HTML and one URL will work on all devices
Programming on the back end can accomplish this	Requires a separate domain (and thus separate URL) and different HTML from the main site (e.g., www.m.domain.com)
Mobile site may need to be coded to specific screen sizes, which limits the client devices that can use it
Searches / SEO	Because a responsive site uses the same domain, links to it count toward link equity for the main site, which boosts the main site's search rankings
Online marketers need not manage a separate SEO campaign for a responsive mobile site	Because a mobile site uses a different domain, links to it do not count toward link equity for the main site, which dilutes search rankings
Online marketers must manage a separate SEO campaign for the mobile site
User experience	Content that lives on one site with one URL is easier to interact with, share and link to
Better for SEO as well	Content is on a separate mobile site, which may diminish or duplicate some aspects of use
Maintenance	Content that lives on one site with one URL is easier to update and maintain	Content is on a separate mobile site, which requires separate processes to update and maintain
Forward compatibility	More forward-compatibility
Programming may require few or no changes to adapt to future devices and browsers	Next-generation mobile devices and browsers may require a mobile site to be reworked in the future
