The Web is based upon an event-driven model. For example, whenever you click an item on a Web page, an event occurs. You are in control: You can choose to click or not click, move the mouse or not move the mouse, or change the URL at will. Because of the unpredictability of a user's actions, programming modules (called methods or functions) can be created that are independent of each other.

Events can trigger functions. Event triggers can be as simple as the user clicking a button, clicking or moving the mouse over a hyperlink, or entering text into a text field. Scripting can be tied to any of these events. You will learn to use JavaScript to instruct the browser what to do or display using the event that you designate as the trigger for the script.

Client-side JavaScript is part of the text within your HTML document. When your browser retrieves a scripted page, it executes the JavaScript programs and performs the appropriate operations in response to user events.
